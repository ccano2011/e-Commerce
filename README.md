## MVP

<!-- > The Minimum Viable Product should be a well-planned, easily-communicated product, ensuring that the client's deliverable will be achievable and meet specifications within the time frame estimated. -->

<!-- _The **Project Title** MVP lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Phasellus dapibus fermentum risus vitae bibendum. Integer vel ipsum mollis odio sollicitudin ornare eu vel ex. In quis fringilla velit, ac maximus quam. Etiam eget placerat neque. Aenean faucibus sem non nisi lobortis ullamcorper._ -->

- Create a 'Hero' landing section with an interactive background
- Create an 'About' section
- Create a responsive Navbar with a full-screen mobile nav
- Add a card section utilizing display grid instead of flex
- Have a 'Data.js' file that I can import the content instead of hardcoding in everything within each component

### Goals

- _Create a responsive and appealing single-page application_
- _Create reusable components with better coding practices_
- _Improve my CSS/Styled Components abilities,_
- _Showcase my improved coding structure_

## KNOWN ISSUES:

<!-- > Use this section to document ideas you've had that would be fun (or necessary) for your Post-MVP. This will be helpful when you return to your project after graduation! -->
- Each component is not centered in the viewport when using smooth-scroll; will come back to fix that in an other iteration

## Post-MVP:
